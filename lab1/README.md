* [CLI documenation - cfy blueprints](https://conductor.windriver.com/docs/22.03/cli/orch_cli/blueprints/)
* [CLI documentation - cfy deployments](https://conductor.windriver.com/docs/22.03/cli/orch_cli/deployments/)
* [CLI documenation - cfy executions](https://conductor.windriver.com/docs/22.03/cli/orch_cli/executions/)

## Uploading Blueprints

The quickest way to upload blueprints to a Cloudify manager is with the command line via the `cfy blueprint upload` command. This should be executed from within the directory containing the blueprint.

Note, you can upload multiple copies of a blueprint file, but each copy will need to have a unique blueprint id.

For example, the following command uploads the hello.yaml blueprint to the Cloudify manager, and gives it a blueprint id of `hello`:

```
>$ pwd
/home/centos/fundamentals-training
[>$ cfy blueprints upload -b hello hello.yaml
Uploading blueprint hello.yaml...
 hello.yaml |##########################################################| 100.0%
Blueprint `hello` upload started.
2022-03-26 11:58:41.589  CFY <None> Starting 'upload_blueprint' workflow execution
2022-03-26 11:58:41.676  LOG <None> INFO: Blueprint archive uploaded. Extracting...
2022-03-26 11:58:41.847  LOG <None> INFO: Blueprint archive extracted. Parsing...
2022-03-26 11:58:44.445  LOG <None> INFO: Blueprint parsed. Updating DB with blueprint plan.
2022-03-26 11:58:44.707  CFY <None> 'upload_blueprint' workflow execution succeeded
Blueprint uploaded. The blueprint's id is hello
```

Blueprints can also be uploaded via the UI, but they should be zipped first. For example, the following command will zip up the lab blueprints so that they can be uploaded via the UI. Notice that the `zip` is executed from **one directory above** the directory containing the blueprints.

```
>$ pwd
/home/centos
>$ ls
fundamentals-training
>$ zip -r fundamentals-training.zip fundamentals-training/ -x 'fundamentals-training/.git/*'

## Other Blueprints Commands

You can use the CLI help to explore commands/subcommands.
```
>$cfy blueprints -h

## Adding a Blueprint Label

Let's add a label to our `hello` blueprint. First, let's check the CLI help to see how to do that.

```
>$cfy blueprints labels -h
Usage: cfy blueprints labels [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --manager TEXT         Connect to a specific manager by IP or host
  -q, --quiet            Show only critical logs
  --format [plain|json]
  -v, --verbose          Show verbose output. You can supply this up to three
                         times (i.e. -vvv)

  --json
  -h, --help             Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  add     Add labels to a specific blueprint
  delete  Delete labels from a specific blueprint
  list    List the labels of a specific blueprint
```
Now, you can add a label:
```
>$cfy blueprints labels add training:lab1 hello
Adding labels to blueprint hello...
The following label(s) were added successfully to blueprint hello: [{'training': 'lab1'}]
```
## Creating a deployment
Use the CLI help to explore the `deployments` command on your own. And then create a deployment environment.
```
>$cfy deployments create hello -b hello
Creating new deployment from blueprint hello...
Deployment `hello` created. The deployment's id is hello
```

## Installing a Deployment

Now, you can run the install workflow.
```
>cfy exec start install -d hello

* Run 'cfy events list f08398f6-7e7e-4d0e-8226-7ec35830eb62' to retrieve the execution's events/logs
```
You can check the deployments output to find the endpoint of the web application.
```
>cfy deployments output hello
Retrieving outputs for deployment hello...
 - "application_endpoint":
     Description: The external endpoint of the application.
     Value: http://<MANAGER_IP>:8000

```
Open the link in your browser. Congrats! You've deployed your first application.

## Updating a Deployment
First, let's check the deployment inputs by looking at hello.yaml or with the CLI.
```
>cfy deployments inputs hello
Retrieving inputs for deployment hello...
 - "webserver_port":
     Value: 8000
```
And now we'll update the deployment to use a different port.

```
 cfy deployments update -i 'webserver_port=8800' hello
